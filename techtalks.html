                <h2>What are Tech Talks?</h2>
                <p>Well, we can first start off with the "why". So, why assets and resources? Well, you can't get much done without them otherwise, of course! Resources refer to 
                    things such as softwares and other things that we use to make game devving easier, and so, here we have compiled
                    a list of resources that we have used in games of our very own!
