        <h2>Assets? Like what?</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2014, Gamespawn @ University of California Riverside is a student organization that focuses on introducing
            students to game development. Our organization teaches students game design, art, and programming through
            competitions and guest speakers. We do our best not only to motivate and encourage students to learn about
            game development, but also to provide a professional and comfortable environment for engineers,
            programmers, designers, and artists.</p>
