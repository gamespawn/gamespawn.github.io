event-description: "If you plan on pitching a project you must either attend the Team Leader Workshop (TLW) or watch the recording as you will have to take the TLW quiz before submitting your pitch. In this workshop you will learn how to be an efficient project lead, some project lead expectations and how to create a game pitch.
We will later provide pitching assistance, feedback and answer any project-related questions during Team Lead Office hours. Keep an eye out for further announcements regarding the dates!"
