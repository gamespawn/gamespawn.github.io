description: "In this world, there are two opposing forces: the destructive force of monsters who seek to dominate versus the reparative force of humans who desire to protect their way of life. The war between chaos and order is eternal, with many fierce battles taking place across the world - in bustling cities, in freezing tundras, in ancient deserts. Will humans successfully rebuild what has been destroyed, or will all be lost to the monsters? Control Scheme: WASD/Arrow Keys to move Click to Attack if Kaiju, Click to Repair if Fixer."
