description: "Welcome to UCJJ! I’m Mio, and I’ll be your tour guide and Resident Assistant for the summer you’ll be spending here. Even though it’s a summer school full of expectations, work, and decisions, it’s also a summer school with cute girls! They all hail from different regions, so make sure you spend some time getting to know them. I bet this school is different from anything you’ve experienced in Japan. Finding a special someone at this school isn’t going to be easy, especially since they all have their personal schedules. So what are you going to do this summer? If you work hard enough, maybe you’ll garner the attention of a certain girl… but from who?"
