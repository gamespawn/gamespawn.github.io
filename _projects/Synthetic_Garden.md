description:
    "People aren't all created equal. Eva understands this. But maybe with her skills, they don't have to be in order to find what they're looking for.
    As a mechanic familiar with body modification, Eva crawls the city every day, eking out a living working for clients turned away by everyone else. Jobs that require modifying the body are easy, but modifying the soul is a different task altogether. "
