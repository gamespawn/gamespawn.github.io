description: "Three young people, each afflicted with a misfortune that stole away what made their homes for them, must work together to solve puzzles and defeat evil wraiths to search the Mortdecai Mansion for three items: -the Gardenia of Inigo for Amica, who longs to reunite with her late parents following a horrific crash, -the Gauntlet of Delilah for Hector, who lost his ability to follow in his father and grandfather's NFL footsteps in the same crash, -and the Tome of Athena for Mason, whose mistake cost him his family's support, and the other two the people and dreams they loved. Each of these characters believe that these items will rebuild what they thought made their homes, but they will find that some things play a different role than expected."
