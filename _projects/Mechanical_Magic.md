description: "Following both the appearance of otherworldly technology and the murder of her professor, a college student and her friend go out on a journey to discover the truth behind these events. A top-down RPG that shifts to 2D beat-'em-up-esque action in battles, inspired by both classic and modern JRPGs. The demo showcases one scene and some of the basic functions of the game."
