description: "Whisked away into a magical realm, high school student Corrin journeys with their fearless, feline companion in search of the portal that connects their home to this isekai-style world. The tactical, turn-based RPG reminisces the classic Gameboy Fire Emblem series and centers on themes of identity and friendship."
