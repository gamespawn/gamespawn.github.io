description: "Cartoony game where you play as a gladiator fighting round after round of increasingly more challenging enemies, with stronger and more wacky weapons becoming available the longer you survive. Since this was a short-term project, the focus was on creating a working combat system with combos and the ability to equip different weapons and shields."
