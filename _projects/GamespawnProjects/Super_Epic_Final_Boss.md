description: "You are a plucky protagonist, reaching the end of an epic turn-based JRPG. One more fight to go, and that's it, right? Not so fast, however, as the evil Jayden puts a curse on your party, forcing you to learn a whole new combat system! Can you survive the learning curve, jankiness, and hackneyed writing to save the day?"
